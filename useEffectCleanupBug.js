This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a cleanup function that throws an error.  The error is often silent and difficult to debug because it's not caught by typical `try...catch` blocks within the `useEffect` function itself.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = someAsyncOperation().subscribe(data => {
    // ... handle data
  });

  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe(); // This might throw if subscription is already unsubscribed or null
  };
}, []);
```
