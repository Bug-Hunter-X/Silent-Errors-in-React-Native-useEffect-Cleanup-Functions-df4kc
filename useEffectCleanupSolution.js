To fix this, wrap the cleanup logic in a `try...catch` block, and optionally log the error for debugging purposes:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = someAsyncOperation().subscribe(data => {
    // ... handle data
  });

  return () => {
    try {
      subscription.unsubscribe();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error in useEffect cleanup:', error);
      // Optionally, add more sophisticated error handling here, 
      // such as reporting the error to a service or using a global error handler.
    }
  };
}, []);
```

This ensures that even if `subscription.unsubscribe()` throws an error, the error is logged and won't silently cause unexpected application behavior.  Consider more sophisticated error reporting mechanisms like Sentry or a custom error reporting system for production apps.
