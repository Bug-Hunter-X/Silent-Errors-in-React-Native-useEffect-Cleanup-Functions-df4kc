# Silent Errors in React Native useEffect Cleanup Functions

This repository demonstrates a common, yet often silent, bug in React Native applications involving the `useEffect` hook and its cleanup function.  The issue arises when an error occurs within the cleanup function, but this error isn't caught or reported in a way that's easily debuggable.

The provided code reproduces this issue. The solution shows how to prevent this silent failure by adding robust error handling to the cleanup function.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the application on a simulator or device.
4. Observe that (in this example), there will be no visible crash or error message, but unexpected behavior or silent data loss might occur if the cleanup function fails.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates how to add comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage potential errors during cleanup.
